    "ciberseguranca": "Cybersecurity",
    "ciberseguranca_desc": "Researcher in the area of DevSecOps, focused on static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) analysis of vulnerabilities in the systems of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Minas Gerais (MPMG) and the Integrated Security Office (GSI). In addition, with an article published in the Integrated Software and Hardware Seminar (SEMISH) 2025.",

    "simplex": "Optimization - Simplex",
    "simplex_desc": "Developed by George Dantzig in 1947, the Simplex algorithm is a powerful and efficient method for solving linear programming problems. This work was developed during the Operations Research course (DCC035), taught by Professor Cristiano Arbex Valle (PhD in Applied Mathematics). The project was implemented in Python and uses the extended LP model, providing optimality/infeasibility certificates. Thus, it can solve various LPs with great performance.",
    "gps": "Data Analysis - GPS Fórmula UFMG",
    "gps_desc": "A GPS system was developed for the UFMG racing team’s car. This system used the following technologies: Arduino, C++, U-blox NEO-6M GPS, Google Colab, Python, Pandas, Folium, Plotly, and TinyGPS.",
    "gps_desc2": "The development was end-to-end, from assembling the components on Arduino to processing and analyzing the collected data. You can view the analyses and even test the code with other GPS data in the same U-blox format.",
